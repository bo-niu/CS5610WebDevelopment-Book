## Chapter 2

### Terminology and My Understanding
In this chapter, I implement a Hello World server. Here are what I learned from the chapter and my thought up until chapter 2.

`DOM`: Document Object Model. In the front end, javascript use DOM to dynamically change the HTML element. Then `React` comes to work as an additional better module to replace the standalone javascriptDOM.

*javascriptDOM*:
```html
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
</script>
```

*ReactDOM*:
```html
<script>
    const element = React.createElement('div', {title: 'Outer div'},
        React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello World!')
    );
    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('content'));
</script>
```

`JSX`: Javascript XML. React.createElement has nested structure to create its sub-element. It will be messy when the hierarchy becomes large. React uses a markup language called JSX to address this.

*JSX*:
```html
<script>
    const element = (
    <div title="Outer div">
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
    );
    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('content'));
</script>
```

`nvm`: Node Version Manager. Tool makes installation and switching
between multiple versions of Node.js easy.

`npm`: default package manager for Node.js.

`Express`: The HTTP server in the Node.js environment.

`Babel`: Tool to transform JSX into JavaScript and transform newer JS into old ones for old browser support.

### Short Summary on How the Development Environment Get Configured

first we install nvm, then we install Node.js by nvm `$ nvm install 10`. Installing Node.js via nvm will also install npm. To install npm globally use `$ npm install â€“g npm@6`. `$ npm init` to init the npm, which will create folders to store all the third packages and dependencies. Install express by `$ npm install express@4`. By running `$ node server.js` starts the server where server.js contains code for the express server.

To better configure the development process and project easy to run, we configured the following:
1. JSX Transform in server side

    separate out JSX from JavaScript into .jsx files. Ex. 
   
   `<script type="text/babel" src="/App.jsx"></script>`
   
    Install `Babel` by `$ npm install --save-dev @babel/core@7 @babel/cli@7`. Since Babel is installed somewhere in the npm folder, we can easily find and use it using a convenient command called `npx` which resolves the correct *local* path of any executable. Comparison: `$ node_modules/.bin/babel --version` VS `$ npx babel --version`.

    Execute `$ npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react@7` and `$ npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env@7`. Create *.babelrc* files in the source folder that we want to perform the transformation.  

    Execute `$ npm install nodemon@1` to implement the functionality of restarting server whenever there are changes.

2. Change package.json: 

    `"start": "nodemon -w server server/server.js",`

    `"compile": "babel src --out-dir public",`

    `"watch": "babel src --out-dir public --watch --verbose"`
